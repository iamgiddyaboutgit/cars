The file model_year_vs_calendar_time.csv was created using data from

https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/us-vehicle-inventory-record-high-september-2024.html

and digitized using

https://automeris.io/wpd/

Some 0 values were artificially placed into the dataset in a way that makes logical sense.  (Cars of a given model year can only start being sold on January 2nd of of the previous calendar year.  Also, new cars don't remain unsold for longer than 2 years.)
