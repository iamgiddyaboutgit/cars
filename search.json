Colors that do not look good on cars are absent. It is debatable whether or not the colors people pick for their cars are what they prefer or if they are just choosing what is cheap/available for a given model.\n\n\n\n\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json\n\n\nFigure 2: Vehicle Colors in Sample. Each vehicle color is plotted in OKLAB color space.\n\n\n\n\nCaveats: No attempts are made to account for non-sampling errors such as non-response and measurement errors–or to correct for sampling error. Measurement errors are likely due to the highly reflective nature of most car paints. The vehicle colors in the target population may differ. However, based on personal experience observing vehicles in the target population outside of this study, the author does not expect the color distribution to be dramatically different in the target population.",

Herein, we explore these preferences in Utah County, Utah, United States. in March 2025 for on-highway vehicles.\nTarget Population: All on-highway, operable vehicles driven in Utah County in March 2025 which were owned or leased by people who could be considered residents of said county for at least part of March 2025. We exclude vehicles owned or leased by businesses.\nSampled Population: All vehicles present at one of the selected locations at one of the selected times with readable and verifiable license plates.",

We will discard units with unreadable license plates or with license plates that cannot be verified on clearvin.com. We will also only include one observation for vehicles seen more than once.",
